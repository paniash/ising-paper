    We investigate the applications in machine learning in physical systems such as the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Ising spin models.
    With regards to the case of 1D, we observe that training a linear regression model for finding the coupling constant \( J \) leads to overfitting and variants of this regression model i.e. Lasso and Ridge regression yield better results with the featured advantage being that the model avoids overfitting.

    Implementation of the Metropolis algorithm was done to generate lattice data for the two-dimensional model.
    Our model was trained using supervised learning with a modified implementation of the Random Forests (RF) classifier scheme using a transductive approach.
    Comparison with the vanilla RF algorithm is seen with a clear score improvement in the case of our modified implementation.

    Future aspects of the work presents an opportunity to explore unsupervised schemes via deep Boltzmann machines.
