\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory} 

For any Ising spin model consisting of spin particles such as atoms/molecules, we consider a lattice (depending on the dimension of the system under consideration) with \( N \) spin particles, whose Hamiltonian is given by

\begin{equation}
    \vec{H} = \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle}^{N, N} J_{ij} \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j
\end{equation}

where \( J_{ij} \) is the coupling strength (parameter quantifying the interaction between spin particles), \( \sigma_{i/j} \) is the spin of the particles (+1 for spin-\( \uparrow \) and -1 for spin-\( \downarrow \)).

Note that we ensure an interaction upto the first nearest neighbours i.e. immediate neighbours of a spin particle.
This is denoted by \( \langle i, j \rangle \).
