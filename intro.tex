\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

The motivation behind our project is to investigate applications of machine learning in determining parameters in physical systems which are usually difficult to do so via a numerical approach.
In this project, we will be focusing on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Ising spin models consisting of spin-1/2 atoms with either spin-\( \uparrow \) or spin-\( \downarrow \).

This project is divided into two parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Finding the coupling constant \( J \) of the one-dimensional spin lattice.
    \item Classifying the phase orderness of a two-dimensional lattice depending on if the lattice temperature is beyond a critical point.
\end{enumerate}
